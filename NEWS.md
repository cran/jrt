* Made Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) the default option in model comparisons.


# jrt 1.0.1

* Simulated dataset is now directly included as `jrt::ratings`.
* Model weights (often called Akaike weights) are now presented in the model selection output (per reviewer suggestion).
* Calls to `mirt` can now be showed with `show.calls = TRUE` argument in the `jrt()`function.
