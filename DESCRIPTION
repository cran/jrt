Description: Psychometric analysis and scoring of judgment data using polytomous Item-Response Theory (IRT) models, as described in Myszkowski and Storme (2019) <doi:10.1037/aca0000225>. A convenience function is used to automatically compare and select models, as well as to present a variety of model-based statistics. Plotting functions are used to present category curves, as well as information, reliability and standard error functions.
